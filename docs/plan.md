### Key Principles

- **Privacy-First**: All processing local, no cloud dependencies
- **Offline-Only**: No internet required for core functionality
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, macOS
- **Remote Access**: Secure global access via VPN/mesh networking
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between voice I/O and AI processing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Voice Infrastructure

#### Vibespeak Voice Service

**Technology Stack:**

- **STT**: Vosk (offline, multi-language support)
- **TTS**: TTS crate (Rust native, cross-platform)
- **Audio I/O**: CPAL (cross-platform audio) + Rodio (playback)
- **Networking**: WebRTC + WebSocket for browser integration
- **IPC**: Local socket communication with Vibe CLI

**Key Features:**

- Real-time speech recognition with voice activity detection
- High-quality text-to-speech with voice selection
- Browser-based interface with WebRTC audio streaming
- Context-aware responses using AI context from Vibe CLI
- Persistent conversation history and user preferences

**Service Architecture:**

```rust
pub struct VoiceService {
    stt_engine: VoskEngine,
    tts_engine: TTSEngine,
    webrtc_server: WebRTCServer,
    websocket_server: WebSocketServer,
    context_manager: ContextManager,
    conversation_history: ConversationHistory,
}
```

#### Vibe CLI Voice Client

**Integration Points:**

- Voice command processing with full AI context
- Real-time audio streaming to/from Vibespeak
- Context sharing for intelligent voice responses
- Web interface for voice interactions
- Remote access coordination

**Client Architecture:**

```rust
pub struct VoiceClient {
    webrtc_client: WebRTCClient,
    websocket_client: WebSocketClient,
    context_provider: ContextProvider,
    audio_processor: AudioProcessor,
}
```

### Phase 2: Browser-Based Interface

#### WebRTC Audio Streaming

**Real-time Communication:**

- Low-latency audio capture/playback in browser
- Secure peer-to-peer connection to local service
- Voice activity detection and noise filtering
- Automatic audio format conversion

**User Interface:**

- Simple, mobile-responsive web interface
- Voice recording controls with visual feedback
- Text transcription display
- Conversation history
- Status indicators for AI processing

#### WebSocket Control Channel

**Signaling Protocol:**

- Connection management and status updates
- Context synchronization between services
- Error handling and recovery
- Real-time status updates

### Phase 3: Context-Aware Intelligence

#### AI Context Integration

**Shared Context Types:**

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct VoiceContext {
    pub user_id: String,
    pub current_task: String,
    pub conversation_history: Vec<Message>,
    pub user_preferences: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub session_state: SessionState,
    pub language: String,
    pub speaking_style: SpeakingStyle,
}
```

**Context Flow:**

1. Vibe CLI provides current AI context to Vibespeak
2. Vibespeak uses context for better STT (user accent, terminology)
3. AI context influences TTS (technical vs casual speaking style)
4. Conversation history enables more natural interactions

#### Smart Voice Processing

- Voice activity detection with context awareness
- Speaker identification for multi-user scenarios
- Emotion/tone detection for appropriate responses
- Command vs conversation mode switching

### Phase 4: Remote Access Infrastructure

#### Tailscale Integration (Primary)

**Mesh Networking:**

- Zero-configuration secure networking
- End-to-end encryption using WireGuard
- Global access without router configuration
- Device authorization and management

**Setup Process:**

1. Install Tailscale on voice server and client devices
2. Create personal tailnet with device approval
3. Configure voice services to bind to Tailscale interface
4. Access voice AI via Tailscale IPs from anywhere

**Security Features:**

- Zero-trust networking (explicit device authorization)
- Automatic key rotation and expiry
- No internet exposure of voice services
- Local processing with remote access

#### Alternative Remote Access

**WireGuard VPN (Advanced):**

- Self-hosted VPN for maximum privacy
- Learning opportunity for networking concepts
- Requires VPS or router configuration
- Full control over infrastructure

**Ngrok Tunneling (Development):**

- Quick testing without infrastructure setup
- Free tier for temporary access
- Less private (traffic through ngrok servers)
- Good for prototyping and learning

### Phase 5: User Experience & Workflows

#### Daily Usage Patterns

**Local Desktop Usage:**

- Voice commands integrated with existing workflows
- i3/tmux/Vim/terminal automation via Vibespeak
- AI assistance via Vibe CLI voice interface
- Seamless handoff between automation and AI

**Remote Mobile Access:**

- Secure access via Tailscale from anywhere
- Context preservation across devices
- Mobile-optimized interface

#### Voice Command Categories

**System Automation:**

- "Open terminal in workspace 2"
- "Switch to neovim and open file"
- "Show me the current git status"

**AI Assistance:**

- "What's the best way to optimize this Rust code?"
- "Explain this error message"
- "Help me debug this issue"

**Contextual Commands:**
